## Cloud-Resume-Challenge
üõ†Ô∏è AWS SERVICES USED:
- AWS S3
- AWS CloudFront


‚úÖ Troubleshooting:

During the deployment of my Cloud Resume Challenge, I encountered and resolved several issues that strengthened my understanding of AWS services and web hosting best practices:

1. ‚ùå ‚Äú404 Not Found ‚Äì NoSuchWebsiteConfiguration‚Äù
   
Issue:
When I first accessed my S3 bucket‚Äôs endpoint, I received a 404 error indicating that the website configuration was missing.

Root Cause:
Although the index.html file was uploaded, static website hosting had not been enabled for the S3 bucket.

Fix:
I enabled static website hosting in the S3 bucket settings and specified index.html as the index document. This allowed the content to be served properly from the S3 endpoint.

2. ‚ùå ‚Äú403 Forbidden ‚Äì Access Denied via CloudFront‚Äù
   
Issue:
After integrating CloudFront, attempting to load the site through the distribution URL returned a 403 error.

Root Cause:
The S3 bucket was private, and CloudFront didn‚Äôt have permission to fetch the content.

Fix:
I switched from the S3 website endpoint (s3-website-...) to the S3 REST API endpoint (s3.<region>.amazonaws.com), which supports Origin Access Control (OAC). I then created an OAC and attached it to CloudFront. Finally, I updated the bucket policy to allow s3:GetObject access from my specific CloudFront distribution using the SourceArn condition.

‚úÖ Outcome

All issues were successfully resolved, and the resume site is now:

- Fully functional and styled

- Delivered securely via CloudFront with private S3 bucket access

- Efficiently cached and updatable with invalidation when needed

This debugging journey helped reinforce core AWS concepts such as IAM policies, S3 static hosting, CloudFront OAC, and cache control.
